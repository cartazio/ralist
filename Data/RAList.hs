-- A random-access list implementation based on Chris Okasaki's approach
-- on his book \"Purely Functional Data Structures\", Cambridge University
-- Press, 1998, chapter 9.3.
--
-- 'RAList' is a replacement for ordinary finite lists.
-- 'RAList' provides the same complexity as ordinary for most the list operations.
-- Some operations take /O(log n)/ for 'RAList' where the list operation is /O(n)/,
-- notably indexing, '(!!)'.
